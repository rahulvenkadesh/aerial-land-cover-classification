Deep learning-based aerial image land cover classification using Tailored UNET and satellite imagery.

# Aerial Land Cover Classification using Tailored U-Net

This project demonstrates semantic segmentation of aerial images for land cover classification using a custom-designed U-Net model built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## üß† Model Architecture

- Tailored U-Net with:
  - Encoder: Multiple Conv2D + BatchNorm + Dropout layers
  - Decoder: Conv2DTranspose + skip connections from encoder
  - Output layer: Softmax for multi-class classification
- Input image size: **256x256x3**
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
